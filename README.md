__Custom rules to remove Dickbars with 1Blocker.__

Inspired by [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/medium_dickbars), i started developing custom rules for [1Blocker](https://1blocker.com) which gets rid of these annoying pieces of shit.

This is pretty much a work in progress, so keep updating the .1blockpkg from right here!

Simply download the [Dickbars.1blockpkg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seiz/dickbar-1blocker/master/Dickbars.1blockpkg) file by right-cklicking on the URL to the left and selecting "Save asâ€¦" in the context-menu. Then double-click on the downloaded file to install it in 1Blocker.
